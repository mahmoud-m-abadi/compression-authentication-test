## Lendo Code Challenge

There is 5 test units (3 items for Compression and 2 items for Authentication)
As you mentioned in the described txt file, I made config file for compression service and you can set defined filename, filetype, file to compress and path file to save compressed file based on desired type.

For authentication service i used the Google authentication using Socialite package.
There are test units using Mocking the Socialite provider and it returns user data in the end.

Finally, please check the env.example file to see related keys in order to service's config. And also I added my .env file on purpose to test system easier.
